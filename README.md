# Coding_interview_template
  <l>A template for most coding interviews. </l>
  
  Most coding interviews will ask the developer to build a 2 or 3 screens app.
  
  Usually the developer will be asked to parse and present a list of items from some server on the first screen.
  
  Clicking on a list item will trigger another service call. 
  
  The later service call will parse and present details about the clicked item.
